# CONTINUE THIS WORK:
### GET CAUGHT UP ON CODEYEAR.COM!!!
Do all the assignments they've released up to this week.  
Put a link to your codecademy profile on your github page.  


### CHOOSE 3 JAVASCRIPT/JQUERY PROJECTS THAT YOU THINK ARE REALLY COOL AND USEFUL AND COMPILE INFORMATION ABOUT THEM.  
- each of you will decide on 3 different js projects that are open source and that you think are useful.  
  - find and complete a 'hello world' tutorial for each project.  
  - create a blog post for each project that details the following things:  
    - where the source code of the project is stored.  
    - where issues for the project are filed.  
    - a list of links to the best resources you've found for learning the project, including a link to the project's api documentation.  
    - a link to a demonstration of your 'hello world' example you completed.
- talk as a group about which projects you're choosing, how to find the projects, what projects might be best or most useful.  
- github.com is a common place to find this kind of stuff, and there are many blogs that daily discuss new js projects.  


## notes:

- submit pull requests to the winter-2012 repo with all assignments from the previous weeks.
