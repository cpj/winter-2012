### a secret, unexpected challenge!  

### remember to do blog posts!  
1. a blog post that synthesizes what you've learned about design, web development, leadership, etc. --whatever we're working on each week.  
2. a blog post that details your progress with that week's lab assignment and with your work on the group project that week. make sure to include screenshots and links to your projects.  
3. a blog post (posted on friday) that lists everything you've done that week, and that discusses the challenges you've faced over the week. this should be a more reflective post, similar to the weekly learning evals.  

*also:* do some blog posts throughout the week that are links to relevant projects, websites, blog posts, etc.

  - leaflet dependency files. [download leaflet](http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/).  
  - skeleton css framework files [download skeleton]().  
  - follow [this tutorial](http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/examples/quick-start.html) to get started.
