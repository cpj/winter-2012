### a secret, unexpected challenge!  

### create an infographic using illustrator.  
- come up with an idea.  
- sketch out your infographic on paper.  
- design it using illustrator.  

### find some awesome infographics
- each of you find at least 3 infographics that are particularly effective in conveying info.
- write a blog post (in addition to the posts you're already doing) that shows an image of each infographic, a description of why you think it is important, and a list of ideas these infographics give you for making your own infographics.  


### remember to do blog posts!  
1. a blog post that synthesizes what you've learned about design, web development, leadership, etc. --whatever you're reading and working on each week.  
2. a blog post that details your progress with that week's lab assignment and with your work on the group project that week. make sure to include screenshots and links to your projects.  
3. a blog post (posted on friday) that lists everything you've done that week, and that discusses the challenges you've faced over the week. this should be a more reflective post, similar to the weekly learning evals.  

*also:* do some blog posts throughout the week that are links to relevant projects, websites, blog posts, etc.  

## lab assignment:  
### work together to identify which cheatsheets for programming, web development, and command line work for which you should create poster-sized infographics.
- create at least 3-5 different cheatsheets.
- design them in illustrator.
- think about these giant cheatsheets as infographics. decide what's most important. what info should be at the top? what should be in a big font? what info could be best described using images?
