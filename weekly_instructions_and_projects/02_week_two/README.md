### a secret, unexpected challenge!  

### remember to do blog posts!  
1. a blog post that synthesizes what you've learned about design, web development, leadership, etc. --whatever we're working on each week.  
2. a blog post that details your progress with that week's lab assignment and with your work on the group project that week. make sure to include screenshots and links to your projects.  
3. a blog post (posted on friday) that lists everything you've done that week, and that discusses the challenges you've faced over the week. this should be a more reflective post, similar to the weekly learning evals.  

*also:* do some blog posts throughout the week that are links to relevant projects, websites, blog posts, etc.  

### each of you will create a wireframe for a news website like cooperpointjournal.com.  
- each of you will create a wireframe using fireworks based on what you learned from the fireworks cs4 tutorials from lynda.com.  
- create a wireframe for the front page, a section page, and an article page, and be sure to allow for responsive design in planning the layout.  
- you'll need to find a bunch of stock images, videos, and text to use as your example content.  

## lab assignment   
- turn the wireframe for the news site into html using the skeleton css framework to handle responsive design.  
- deploy this html site to heroku.  
- install heroku on your vagrant box using "gem install heroku"  
- make sure you have a heroku account set up. http://heroku.com  
- run "heroku keys:add" in the terminal window for your vagrant box to set up ssh keys for your vagrant box on heroku.  
- create a config.ru file and paste in [the suggested config.ru contents from this tutorial](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/static-sites-on-heroku).  
- follow the [heroku quickstart guide](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart) to deploy your site.
