_complete blog posts by monday, 10 a.m., week 10._  
# a blog post of about 1000 words:  
1. a blog post that synthesizes the assignments and the readings. Expecially focus on the ideas in The Design of Everyday Things and how to apply that to web development.  

###These blog posts shouls be like normal:  
2. a blog post that details your progress with that week's lab assignment and with your work on the group project that week. make sure to include screenshots and links to your projects.  
3. a blog post (posted on friday) that lists everything you've done that week, and that discusses the challenges you've faced over the week. this should be a more reflective post, similar to the weekly learning evals.
