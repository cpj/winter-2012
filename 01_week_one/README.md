## assignments:
_Finish assignments by 10 a.m., Monday of week 2._

### web services
- Sign up for [codeyear.com](http://codeyear.com)
- Create a personal blog at [tumblr.com](http://tumblr.com)
- Create a personal account on [heroku.com](http://heroku.com)
- Create a personal account on [github.com](http://github.com)

### git + github
- Follow and fork the [cpj winter-2012 repository](https://github.com/cpj/winter-2012).
- Create a personal github pages website. [Use these instructions](http://pages.github.com/).
- Work together to create a github pages website for the cpj. Note that I've [gotten it started for you](https://github.com/cpj/cpj.github.com).

### development environment
- Set up a vagrant environment in the 01_week_one folder of the winter 2012 repository by following the Getting Started directions from the reading.
- Make sure to forward a port so you can view your project in the browser.
- set up the winter 2012


### project / agile development / teamwork
- Decide on first project.
- First sprint planning meeting.

## lab assignment:
For this week's lab each of you will submit a personal github pages website, and you'll work together to create a github pages website for the cpj.
The cpj site will highlight the open source projects the cpj currently uses.
All sites should use the skeleton css framework.
Don't worry about making these sites flashy and all javascripted-up. But consider making revisions, especially to your personal sites, as you learn new skills each week.
Your personal sites will serve as your portfolios at the end of the quarter, so update these sites to reflect all the work you've done.
### Make sure your personal sites have links to all your profiles on the web services you're using for the contract: github, codeschool, heroku, tumblr, etc.


## notes:

### what you'll be creating this quarter:
- websites
- applications
- and really, we're going to be calling your projects apps.
- our goal is to create small, simple apps. we'll work on making these apps work well across devices.

### who you'll be this quarter:
- programmers
- designers
- data analysts / statisticians
- system administrators
- leaders / project managers
- makers
- journalists

### programming languages:
- client-side
  - javascript
  - coffeescript (which is mostly a different version of javascript)
  - java (sort of)
  - client-side code runs in the browser
  - it's often used to control user interaction, design, animation, etc.
- server-side
  - javascript (whoa, what? using projects like node.js, javascript can be run on the server.
  - ruby
  - python
  - php
  - java
  - server-side code controls the logic of your application
- markup
  - html
  - markdown
  - xml
  - markup isn't a programming language. whoaaaaa!
  - markup controls the design structure of your app.
- stylesheets
  - css (cascading style sheets)
  - less, stylus, sass - these are css frameworks that allow you to write simpler stylesheets. they all compile to css.
  - stylesheets are what control the look - the _style_ - of your app.

### content management systems (CMSs):
- drupal, wordpress, joomla, etc.
- allow users to build sites through the ui, with minimal need for editing code.
- CMSs can be installed and have most of the functionality you'll need ready.
- building a site is often a subtractive process, because the CMSs and associated modules/plugins make assumptions about what you want to do.

### frameworks:
- ruby on rails, django, express, (drupal?), play, sinatra/padrino, flask, etc.
- require developers to write code to create the functionality.
- an additive process.

### web stacks:
- lamp: linux, apache, mysql, php/python
- num: node.js, unix, mongodb
- other variations: ruby/python/java/perl, unix/linux/windows/mac, nginx/apache

### web stacks typically break down into these components:
- operating system
- http server
- database
- programming language / framework

An application uses the web server to send information to a browser, uses the database to store information,
and the programming language / framework is in charge of all the logic and templating. The operating system is the
wrapper around all of that functionality, the platform everything runs on.
