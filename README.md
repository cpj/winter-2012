# WINTER CPJ INTERSHIPS !!!!!!

Hello, internshippers.

### Check out [the Monday-Friday schedule](https://github.com/cpj/winter-2012/blob/master/schedule.md).

### Get a sense of the overall plan [by reading the outline](https://github.com/cpj/winter-2012/blob/master/outline.md).

### Use [this wiki](https://github.com/cpj/cpj.github.com/wiki/Intro) to store tutorials, example projects, and documentation you use to help finish assignments.
_Both the schedule and outline may be revised. I'll be sure to warn you if that happens._


## General instructions:

### Create a blog on tumblr.com
- Regular blog posts:
  - you'll be doing 3 blog posts each week about what you're learning about agile development, programming, design, and your progress on assignments.
  - regular blog posts should be roughly 300 words, and include photos and other media as often as possible.
  - see the schedule for details on when to do regular blog posts.
- Following technology and journalism
  - in addition to the assigned blog posts, do as many tiny posts as you can that link to an article, a code or multimedia project, a well designed, or any other online content applicable to the internship.
  - these should be short. a link and a sentence or two explaining why you're interested, or how it relates to the internship.

### Fork this repository:
- This git repository is where you'll store your work for the quarter.
- Make sure you are logged in, then click the fork button toward the top of the screen.
- This'll bring up a window alowing you to fork it to your personal account.
  - For help with forking on github see their [Fork A Repo help page](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/).


### For turning in weekly assignments:
- Create a folder called your name in the week's projects folder.
- Store all of your work for that week in the folder with your name on it.
- Submit your assigment for the week by submitting a pull request to this repository.
  - For help with submitting pull requests, read github's [Send Pull Requests help page](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/).


### For turning in group projects:
- We'll make cpj repos for each group project as we decide what they are.
- Each of you will fork the project repository on the cpj github profile.
- You will submit your work by submitting pull requests throughout the quarter.
- You are expected to keep your personal forks of the project up-to-date by fetching from the cpj repo after others have submitted pull requests.


### Resources:
- I'll be blogging at [cpjwebdev.tumblr.com](http://cpjwebdev.tumblr.com/), and reblogging all the posts you do on your tumblr blogs.
- [This github repo](http://github.com/cpj/winter-2012), of course, will continue to be an important resource.
- You'll be making a list of resources as you go and storing them [in the wiki for this github repo](https://github.com/cpj/cpj.github.com/wiki_pages).
